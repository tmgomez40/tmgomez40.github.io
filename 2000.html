  <h2>Game Cube and Game Boy Advance</h2>
 <h3> 
  The start of the new millennium meant a new era for Nintendo, they were determined to recover from the mistakes and setbacks of the 90s. To accomplish this they released the next generation of both their handheld and console lines in 2001. The Game Boy Advance was the strongest Game Boy yet, sporting a backlight in the screen along with an incredible increase in hardware strength compared to the previous two. It sold very well and was given 2 redesigns in the next few years, the Game Boy Advance SP in 2003, and the Game Boy Micro in 2005. Nintendo’s handheld line was very strong during this period, but the same couldn't be said about their home console, the Game Cube (right). The Game Cube was another step in embracing 3D gaming, being objectively stronger in all fields compared to the N64. But several factors made the Game Cube fall severely short of expectations. There was even more competition in the industry as Microsoft’s Xbox had released the same year, the Playstation 2 having already been released the year before. Along with that, the architecture for creating and porting games to the console was seen as a lot more difficult compared to the competition, with Nintendo not using the now standard DVD format of storing games and instead had them come on mini-discs. Making the console and its games underpowered compared to others. The Game Cube was now Nintendo’s worst selling console, and they knew they had to make changes for the next one.

  <h2>
    DS and Wii
  </h2>
  <h3>
   As the company worked on the next home console, they released a successor to the Game Boy line with the Nintendo DS in 2004. The DS featured a dual screen set up which gave the handheld its name. The DS was designed to be a true step forward compared to the Game Boy Advance, with 3D capabilities and all around incredibly improved hardware. The DS quickly became Nintendo’s greatest financial success, boasting over 154 million units sold, currently the highest amount for any piece of Nintendo hardware. And following after it was the company’s response to the Game Cube, the Wii (left). Released in 2006, the Wii was a console designed to be unique. Nintendo wasn’t looking to join the competition in hardware strength that Playstation and Xbox were currently dominating in, the Wii was meant to be something wholly its own. Instead of a typical controller setup the Wii was controlled through motion controllers via the Wii Remote, lending to games being built around that control scheme. No home console at the time was like the Wii, its creation was a gamble to see if it could stand against the competition. A gamble which paid off as the Wii was the undisputed winner of this generation of consoles. Until recently, it was Nintendo’s best selling console. And Nintendo wanted to keep that going into the next generation.
