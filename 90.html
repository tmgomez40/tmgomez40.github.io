  <h2>SNES and Virtual Boy</h2>
 <h3> 
  Following the incredible success of the NES, Nintendo started work on the next generation of their home consoles. And in 1990 they released the Super Famicom in Japan, with worldwide releases happening in the following years under the name Super Nintendo Entertainment System or “SNES” (right). The SNES was the next step in technological advancement for the company, it was a 16-bit system compared to the NES’s 8-bit. The new technology allowed for better graphics and sound while expanding what was possible for the medium. The SNES was a large success like its predecessor, boasting an incredible library of games. Some of which to this day are hailed as some of the greatest of all time. Some games include The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Mario World, Chrono Trigger, and Earthbound. However, in between the SNES and the next home console release, Nintendo found their domination in the industry waning. Around this time is when Sega, their consoles, and their mascot character Sonic the Hedgehog started taking back some of the monopoly in the global video game market that Nintendo had an iron grip on for around half a decade. They also found themselves abandoning a deal with the Japanese technology company Sony which ended up causing the company to develop the Playstation, another heavy competitor to the company. And then finally in 1995, Nintendo released the Virtual Boy. A 32-bit virtual reality console which saw immense commercial and critical disappointment. It is arguably Nintendo’s biggest failure selling only 770,000 units worldwide.

  <h2>
    N64 and Game Boy Color
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Following the failure of the Virtual Boy, in 1996 Nintendo released an incredible jump forward for the industry, the Nintendo 64 (left). It was Nintendo’s first true step into 3 dimensions, being a 64-bit console the vast majority of games released for the system were 3D. Some of the games released on the platform helped create the foundations for how 3D games would be designed from that point on. Games like Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and GoldenEye 007 all have elements and techniques that are still seen in games today. However, due to the newfound competition Nintendo had, the N64 underperformed compared to their previous consoles. A few years later in 1998 saw the release of the Game Boy Color, the next in the Game Boy line. This iteration allowed for colored pixels to be used in the games as opposed to the monochrome of the original.
