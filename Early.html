  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
 <h3> 
  The story of Nintendo starts all the way back in 1889 in Kyoto, Japan. The company was founded by Fusajiro Yamauchi to manufacture and distribute Hanafuda, a type of Japanese playing card (pictured on the right). They were an alternative to typical playing cards that are sold and played with in western countries as those were banned in Japan during the time. When the ban was lifted in around 1902, Nintendo became the first company in Japan to manufacture western-style playing cards. They even made a deal with Disney in 1958 to produce playing cards with Disney characters on them. But as the 20th century past the halfway point, demand for playing cards in Japan dwindled and Nintendo was looking for new avenues to expand to. They spent the 60s starting to develop physical toys for the Japanese market, which was met with varying success. One of their biggest successes that changed the trajectory of the company was their creation of the Nintendo Beam Gun, an at home light gun toy. This was the start of Nintendo’s entry into the technological world.

    Electronic Era 
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Due to their experience with the Beam Gun line, Nintendo was able to start making their way into the electronic field. In 1972 they worked with the company Magnavox, whose console the Magnavox Odyssey was the first commercial home console ever released, to supply them with a light gun accessory for the console. The development and understanding of this technology led the company to direct their focus their efforts towards the Laser Clay Shooting System in 1973, a light gun shooting simulator that would be set up as a replacement for closed down bowling alleys. Nintendo had found success transitioning from analog to digital, which led to them making the jump into the realm of video games. 1977 saw the release of the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15, two home consoles developed alongside Mitsubishi Electric. And a few years later in 1980, Nintendo would see their first huge success in the video game industry with the Game & Watch line of handheld systems (pictured on the left). Ushering in a new decade of potential for the company.
