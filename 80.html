  <h2>Arcade Age</h2>
 <h3> 
  Nintendo’s first venture into the world of arcade video games was back in 1978 with the release of Computer Othello, a video version of the board game of the same name. But it was in 1981 with the release of Donkey Kong, an arcade game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, that Nintendo had found a permanent place in the world of video games (right). Donkey Kong was an instant success across the globe, quickly becoming Nintendo’s flagship product and setting up the groundwork for their rapid growth in the years to come. The game was ported to several home consoles: the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and ColecoVision. Donkey Kong saw the introduction of the character of Mario who later got an arcade game of his own entitled Mario Bros. The next few years saw Nintendo develop several other arcade games including sequels to Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong 3), before moving their full attention to the home console market with their development of the Famicom.

    NES and Game Boy
  </h2>
  <h3>
   After years of experimenting and developing their skills in the video game industry, Nintendo was ready to release their first ever home cartridge-based video game console created by themselves. Named the Family Computer or “Famicom” (left, top), it was released exclusively in Japan in 1983. The years following would see the console released worldwide, renamed to the Nintendo Entertainment System or “NES” (left, bottom). The NES was an incredible success, so much in fact it helped bring the video game industry out of a recession it was experiencing in America during the mid 1980s. This was caused in large part due to the excess amount of low quality games flooding the market during the time, so Nintendo countered that by releasing incredibly high quality games that managed to change public perception of the medium. Some of these games included the first three games in the Super Mario Bros. franchise, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid. The end of the decade saw the release of the Game Boy, a handheld console which would become the successor to the Game and Watch line. It launched with the game Tetris and saw incredible success, launching the next generation of Nintendo’s handheld efforts.
