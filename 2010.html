  <h2>3DS and Wii U</h2>
 <h3> 
The next in the DS line came in 2011 with the 3DS, a handheld that had stereoscopic 3D, or glasses-free 3D, capabilities. The stereoscopic 3D led to games being able to be built with true depth of field in mind as the screen could show what was in the foreground vs background directly to the user. The 3DS wasn’t as big of a success as the DS but was still a success for the company. The same can’t be said for the next home console, the Wii U released in 2012 (right). Nintendo wanted to keep brand recognition that they had gained with the Wii, and so developed the Wii U as its successor. The Wii U was in two parts, the console box that would be connected to the TV, and the gamepad which would be used as a controller and had a screen in the center. The Wii U was meant to continue the Wii’s idea of creating new ways to play video games, but it instead created a system that was difficult to understand and to develop from. The Wii U was a complete failure for the company, having the lowest unit sales of all of their consoles by far. Nintendo once again needed to have a win with their next console.  </h3>

  <h3>
    Development of the next generation of home consoles was started basically as soon as Nintendo realized the Wii U would be a failure. They knew that they needed to create a success or the company would be in severe jeopardy. They spent years in development even while trying to salvage the Wii U, they wanted to do something different again but in a way that would encourage a playerbase and developers. And in 2017, the Nintendo Switch was released (left), a console that was also a handheld. It could be played like a traditional handheld, but was also able to be connected to the TV and used like a home console. This hybrid style of hardware meant that once again Nintendo would be going for being unique rather than powerful, and just like the Wii, it worked. The Nintendo Switch has become Nintendo’s greatest accomplishment with the highest number of sales compared to all of their other home consoles, and its about to pass the DS line to become the 2nd highest selling console of all time.
